<p>The poet  William Wordsworth  (7 April 1770 – 23 April 1850)
stayed in Souldern in 1820, visiting his friend and former fellow student at Cambridge University, 
<a href="rev-robert-jones-1787-1835/">Robert Jones</a> who was  Rector of Souldern and lived in the (old) old Rectory.
</p>
<p>Wordsworth wrote the sonnet  ‘A Parsonage in
Oxfordshire’ after staying in Souldern.<br /></p>
<h2 id="TOC-A-Parsonage-In-Oxfordshire">A Parsonage In Oxfordshire</h2>
<blockquote>
Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends,<br />
Is marked by no distinguishable line;<br />
The turf unites, the pathways intertwine;<br />
And, wheresoe'er the stealing footstep tends,<br />
Garden, and that domain where kindred, friends,<br />
And neighbours rest together, here confound<br />
Their several features, mingled like the sound<br />
Of many waters, or as evening blends<br />
With shady night. Soft airs, from shrub and flower,<br />
Waft fragrant greetings to each silent grave;<br />
And while those lofty poplars gently wave<br />
Their tops, between them comes and goes a sky<br />
Bright as the glimpses of eternity,<br />
To saints accorded in their mortal hour.
