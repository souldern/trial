<p>
The manor of Souldern has come down through Catholic hands from the
Reformation until the year 1904.</p>
<p>Early in the sixteenth century
it belonged to a branch of the Throckmortons, who have left memorials
of their dead in the church. The family ending in four heiresses, the
property was broken up and sold. A list of Recusants in the county of
Oxford remaining at liberty, 1592, contains the name of John
Stutsburie, of Soldern. In 1610 John Weedon married the daughter of
John Stutsburie, or Stutchberry, and by a deed made that year the
manor passed from Stutsburie to Weedon. This family were widely spread
over the neighbouring counties, the Souldern branch owning property at
Longdon, co. Stafford, and another at Hanley Castle, Worcestershire,
while numerous traces of the name are found in Bucks. and Berks.
</p>
<p>
The
Civil War found John Weedon with his two grown-up sons ardent
supporters of the King, and they consequently suffered sequestration
of two-thirds of their estates at Souldern and Longdon as ‘papists and
delinquents.’ Prosperity did not return to the family; they continued
as Lords of the Manor for a couple of generations, but at last sank
into poverty, and the last John Weedon died in 1710. The Weedon family
bore arms as early as Henry III, and Edmund de Wedone was Constable of
Wallingford Castle in 18th Edward I.
</p>
<p>
A ‘widow Weedon,’ who was
assisted by the parish, was not the widow of the last John Weedon here
mentioned. To all appearance the latter was sister to Charles Howse,
of Kimble, and had her own fortune, returning to Bucks, after her
husband’s death<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>
 The <i>Records of the Jesuits</i> contain many notices of
members of this family, and the <i>Douai Diaries</i> give us the names of two
who took the College oath as pupils, Joseph in 1697 and Bernard in
1700. The trials of Catholic parents in those days are little known or
appreciated now. An Act was passed by Parliament in 1678 forbidding
any Catholic child to be sent abroad for education; and tradition, in
connexion with this, tells us of one of the Catholic youths at
Souldern, that one day while playing by the town well, near his
father’s house, an agent from one of the Colleges abroad suddenly
kidnapped him and hurried him off, to return no more until his
education should
be completed. The father was cognizant of the plot, but the poor mother was left in doubt to lament her child’s possible fate<sup>2</sup>.</p>

In the <i>Calendar of Clarendon
State Papers</i>, vol. i. p. 61, we find a petition from Messrs. Weedon
for protection against informers, 1634–5, signed or endorsed by
Windebank. And later, in a list of papists returned July, 1706 (kept
at Woodstock):—</p>
<p>
‘Souldern; Robert Kilby, Alse, Mary, Jane Kilby,
spinsters; Anne, wife of John Weden; Ann, wife of John Coster; Ann,
wife of Henry Bennett (same as at Hethe); Katherine, wife of John
Neal, mason, and Eliz. his dau.; James and Bridget Horn; Richard

<sup>5</sup>Probably the Archdeacon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Кilby.</p>
<p>At the same date with the Weedons another family, of the name of
Kilby, lived at Souldern. Richard Kilby was at Souldern or thereabouts
in 1638; he signed a lease for a house in Souldern, between John
Hodges, of Wall House, London, and some one in Souldern<sup>1</sup>. The earliest
printed notice we have found of them occurs in Wood’s <i>Life and Times</i>,
vol. ii, p. 53, when writing in 1664 he alludes to various prodigies
which had happened in Oxfordshire, and instances ‘the devill let loose
to possess people, as at Souldern in Mr. Kilbie’s maid.’</p>
<p>
Two
successive Kilbys married into the Reynolds family, of Cassington, and
members of both families lie together in the church. In 1704 the
heiress of the Kilbys married Samuel, son of Gabriel Cox, of
Farningham, Kent, and thus introduces a new name into the parish.</p>
<p>
In
1712 John Weedon died, making his will in favour of the young son of
S. Cox and Alice Kilby. Under what circumstances this took place we
know not, but in 1716 Cosin’s <i>List of Non-Jurors</i> takes no notice of
the Weedon estate, so we may fairly assume it to have been under
litigation at the time. Robert Kilby’s estate is returned as a ‘Fee
simple, a tenement called “Hyatt House” in his own “possession,” and
John Day one of his tenants, £107 18s. 0d.’ He is also returned for
property in Bedfordshire.</p>
<p>
Several poor Catholic families lived in the
village, all of the same names as those enumerated at Somerton, such
as Lepington, Ansty, Horn, Smith; in the Register they are uniformly
marked as ‘Papistae.’</p>
<p>
Mr. Cox died suddenly at Farningham in 1712, and
afterwards his widow and children appear to have lived with her
brother Kilby at Souldern, where she was buried in 1729<sup>3</sup>. In 1746
Mr. Kilby left by will all his landed estates to his nephew Samuel
Cox, who thus became owner of both the Kilby and Weedon estates.</p>
<p>
The
chapel was a long attic, as was usual in these cases, extending over
one wing of the house, and a small room at one end was used as a
vestry, upon the stone window-sill of which is still to be seen the
date 1665<sup>3</sup>, carved in the stone with a cross. The hiding-place for the
priest and chapel furniture, in case of alarm, was under the floor,
close to the door, and so contrived as to be covered by the door when
it was opened. The bolt was inside, and a way of escape appeared
probable through a series of large cupboards, one beneath the other,
to the bottom of the house.</p>
<p style="background-color:#eee;border:solid black thin;text-indent:0em;font-size:90%">
<sup>1</sup>From the Cox family papers.</p>
<p style="background-color:#eee;border:solid black thin;text-indent:0em;font-size:90%">
<sup>2</sup>Rawlinson
visited Souldern in 1718 and reports
that Mrs. Cox lived at the Manor House.
Whether this was Weedon’s Manor
or the house now a the styled so, seems doubtful.</p>
<p style="background-color:#eee;border:solid black thin;text-indent:0em;font-size:90%">
<sup>3</sup>This date of 1665
appears to be conclusive evidence
that the present manor house was
Kilby’s and called ‘Hyatts,’
because Wood says Kilby
 was there in 1664, and we know that Dodwell, of whom he bought the house,  was no Catholic. Can the house have  belonged to the Hyatts of Fritwell?</p>
<p>The Coxes retired to their London house in
1781 (where a few years later they became victims to the Gordon
rioters), taking with them the altar furniture and vestments, and
closing the chapel. After seventy years the wheel revolved and a
chapel was again opened in the old house.</p>
<p>
During these long years the
few remaining faithful heard Mass. at Hardwick and Hethe, a distance
of five miles. One old man was still alive in 1852 who remembered
having been taken as a child to the old chapel in the house; he was
Matthew Smith. In this same year, 1852, on the 15th of August, Mass
was once more said in Souldern House. Another upper room had been
furnished, as the old one had fallen to ruin; the old chalice was once
more used, and the fragments of the old vestments were turned to
account in the chapel. Here service continued for upwards of fifteen
years, as recorded in the account of Hethe. Dr. Dolman died on the
15th of March, 1867, and for a year the priest was provided for in a
farmhouse. In July, 1868, Dr. Dolman’s son-in-law, Bryan John
Stapleton, took Souldern House, and he and Mr. Cox made arrangements
with the Bishop to support a priest in the village. The payment of
£50. hitherto made to Hethe was withdrawn; £25 at first until the
death of Mr. Robson, the remainder upon the occurrence of his death in
1870. A house in the village was procured, and the Rev. Hugh, McCarten
appointed priest the same year. He was succeeded by the Rev. John
Morris, who died at Wappenbury and was removed to his old home for
burial. After him came the Rev. Sam. Glossop in January, 1873, who
still remains at Souldern, respected by all his neighbours, having won
the goodwill and respect of the parish so far as to be consulted upon
all parish matters outside those of his own flock.</p>
<p>
The present chapel
was built by Mrs. Dolman as a memorial to her


late husband, and was opened on the 2nd of February, 1870, by the
Rev. Canon Sullivan, Vicar-General, assisted by several priests, and
Dr. Sweeney preached. The choir of Banbury gave their services for the
occasion. The first child baptized here was Christopher Stapleton;
weddings and burials still went to Hethe’.</p>
<p>
A small well-appointed
school was established in the village under a certificated mistress,
the house and playground being adapted to the purpose by Colonel Cox
from a roomy old cottage and garden adjoining the chapel.</p>
<p>
In the
north-west corner of the church, now covered by pews, are two memorial
slabs:—</p>
<p>
‘Here lyeth the body of Allice, the wife of Richard Kilbye,
gent: who departed this life Decr. 1st, 1714, and in the year of her
age 66.</p>
<p>
Also here lyeth the body of Anne, the wife of Robert Kilbye,
gent: who died Sept. 8th, 1754, aged 84 years.</p>
<p>
And also,</p>
<p>
Here lyeth
the body of Robert Kilbye, gent: who died March 12th, 1757, aged
... years.’</p>
<p>
The last-named was not of age in 1693. The two ladies
above were aunt and niece, and both of them were Reynolds of
Cassington.</p>
<p>
The next was mother to Anne Kilbye, and she was born Anne
Whitgreave:—</p>
<p>
‘Here lyeth the body of Alice Reynolds, Widdow, who
departed this life Aug. 8th. 1694. Also here lyeth the Body of William
Reynolds, gent: son of Alice Reynolds, who departed this life Feby. ye
23d. 1717-18 aetatis suae 71.’</p>
<p>
Wood calls him a ‘monk of Lisbon<sup>2</sup>.’ He
was Archdeacon of the Vicariate of Oxon., Bucks, and Berks, and
educated at Lisbon.</p>
<p>
‘Here lyeth the body of Richard Kilby, Esqre, who
departed this life the 11th day of Sept. 1693, aetatis suae
84. R.I.P. Amen. And also lyeth the body of Alice Cox, daughter of
Richard Kilby, who departed this life on the 7th April 1729, aetatis
suae 53. Here lyeth the body of Helen Bleven, who departed this life
the 3d Oct. 1765, aged 65.’</p>
<p style="background-color:#eee;border:solid black thin;text-indent:0em;font-size:90%">
<sup>1</sup>The altar-rails and the chalice are
those belonging to the original
old chapel in the house. The altar furniture was all presented by members of  the family.</p>
<p style="background-color:#eee;border:solid black thin;text-indent:0em;font-size:90%">
<sup>2</sup><i>Life and Times</i>, vol. i., p. 305.</p>
<p>The following is from <i>Rawlinson MSS.</i>, B 400 (in Bodley):—</p>
<p>‘Here lyeth the body of Jane, daughter of Alice Kilby, who died
Dec. 17th, 1714, in the year of her age 29.’</p>
<p>The death of Jane Kilby
and her mother are entered in the old Britwell Catholic Register kept
at Oxford.</p>
